# doxy2json

***Experimental, alpha stage*** tool to convert [Doxygen] XML output to JSON
to be used with [Jekyll].

## TODO

- A better XML schema to facilitate parsing.

- Some commands are not parsed correctly, like `\details` and `\todo`,
  mainly when using markdown.

- Better and complete management of the generated Doxyfile configuration.
